===================================================================

Keybindings:

* `Ctrl-S` evaluates all expressions in the edit buffer.
* `Alt-PgUp` and `Alt-PgDn` navigates through slides when the editor is active. Otherwise, cursor keys will work, though embarrassingly mainstream.

Inspirations and thanks
